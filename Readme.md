# GCP Data Engineering Foundations

Welcome to the GCP Data Engineering Foundations course! This course is designed to help you understand the basics of data engineering on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will learn how to design, build, and operationalize data processing systems on GCP, including how to provide real-time and batch processing of large datasets.

## Overview

The folders in this repository contain the code and resources for the the hands-on videos for the course. Each folder has it's own Readme file that contains the instructions for the hands-on exercises.

## Repo Setup

To get started with the hands-on exercises, you will need to set up a Google Cloud Platform account and install the necessary tools. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform account if you don't have one already.
2. Install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine.
3. Create a new project on Google Cloud Platform.
4. Enable the necessary APIs for the project.
5. Create a service account and download the key file.
6. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Update the values in the `.env` file with your project details.
7. Install the necessary Python libraries using pip. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
